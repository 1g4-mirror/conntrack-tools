1.Basic Installation
====================

 To compile and install 'conntrackd' just follow the classical steps:

	$ ./configure
	$ make
	# make install
	# mkdir /etc/conntrackd/

2.1. Synchronization Mode
=========================

 Conntrackd can replicate the status of the connections that are currently
 being processed by your stateful firewall based on Linux. This section
 describes how to setup the daemon in synchronization mode:

2.1.1. Requirements

 You have to install the following software in order to get conntrackd working,
 make sure that you have installed them correctly before going forward:

 o linux kernel version >= 2.6.18 (http://www.kernel.org) with support for:
     - connection tracking system (quite obvious ;)
     - nfnetlink
     - ctnetlink (ip_conntrack_netlink)
     - connection tracking event notification API

 o libnfnetlink: the netfilter netlink library

     Since conntrackd version 0.9.2 you can used the official release availble at
     http://www.netfilter.org/projects/libnfnetlink/files/

     Up to conntrackd version 0.9.1 use the unofficial release available at the
     download section

 o libnetfilter_conntrack: the netfilter conntrack library

     Since  conntrackd version 0.9.2 you can used the official release availble at
     http://www.netfilter.org/projects/libnetfilter_conntrack/files/

     Up to conntrackd version 0.9.1 use the unnoficial release available at the
     download section

 o Keepalived version 1.x (http://www.keepalived.org)
     check if your distribution comes with a recent version

2.1.2. Configuration

 1) Setting up keepalived

    There is an example file available inside the conntrackd tarball:

    For node 1: conntrackd-x.x.x/examples/sync/node1/keepalived.conf
    For node 2: conntrackd-x.x.x/examples/sync/node2/keepalived.conf

    These files can be used to set up a simple VRRP cluster composed of
    two machines that hold the virtual IPs 192.168.0.100 on eth0 and
    192.168.1.100 on eth1.

    If you are not familiar with keepalived, please read the official
    docs available at http://www.keepalived.org

    Please, make sure that keepalived is correctly working before passing
    to step 2)

 2) Setting up conntrackd

    To setup 'conntrackd' in synchronization mode, you have to put the
    configuration file in the directory /etc/conntrackd.

    On node 1:
	# cp examples/sync/_type_/node1/conntrackd.conf /etc/conntrackd.conf

    On node 2:
        # cp examples/sync/_type_/node1/conntrackd.conf /etc/conntrackd.conf

    Where _type_ is the synchronization type selected, currently there are
    two: the persistent mode and the NACK mode. The persistent mode consumes
    more resources than the NACK mode, however the NACK mode is still
    experimental

    Do not forget to edit the files in order to adapt them to the
    setting that you are deploying.

    Note: If you don't want to put the config file under /etc/conntrackd,
    just tell conntrackd where to find it passing the option -C

 3) Running conntrackd

    Conntrackd can run in console mode, in that case just type 'conntrackd',
    otherwise, if you want to run it in daemon mode the type 'conntrackd -d'.

 4) Checking that conntrackd is working fine

    Conntrackd comes with several facilities to check its status:

    - Dump the cache of connections that are currently being processed by
      this node (aka. internal cache):

    # conntrackd -i

    - Dump the cache of connections that has been transfered from
      others active nodes in the network (aka. external cache)

    # conntrackd -e

    - Dump statistics collected by the replication daemon:

    # conntrackd -s

 5) Setting up interaction with keepalived

    If keepalived detects the failure of the active node, then it designates
    a candidate node that will replace the failing active. On such event,
    the external cache, eg. the cache that contains the connections processed
    by other nodes, must be commited. To commit the external cache, just type:

    # conntrackd -c

    See that keepalived provides a shell script interface to interact with
    other programs, so we can automate the process of commiting the external
    cache by introducing the following line in the keepalived file:

    notify_master /etc/conntrackd/script_master.sh

    The script 'script_master.sh' just the following:

    #!/bin/sh
    /usr/sbin/conntrackd -c

    Therefore, on failure event, the candidate node takes over the virtual
    IPs and the connections that the failing active was processing. Observe
    that this file differs for the NACK mode.

 6) Disable TCP window tracking

 Until the appropiate patches don't go into kernel mainline, you will have
 to disable TCP window tracking, consider this as a temporary solution:

    # echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/netfilter/ip_conntrack_tcp_be_liberal

2.2. Statistics mode
====================

 Conntrackd can also run as statistics daemon, if you are not interested in
 this mode, just skip it. It is not required in order to get the
 synchronization mode working. This section details how to setup the daemon
 in statistics mode:

2.2.1. Requirements

 You have to install the following software in order to get conntrackd working,
 make sure that you have them installed correctly before going forward:

 o linux kernel version >= 2.6.18 (http://www.kernel.org) with support for:
      - connection tracking system
      - nfnetlink
      - ctnetlink (ip_conntrack_netlink)
      - connection tracking event notification API

 o libnfnetlink: the netfilter netlink library

     Since conntrackd version 0.9.2 you can used the official release availble at
     http://www.netfilter.org/projects/libnfnetlink/files/

     Up to conntrackd version 0.9.1 use the unofficial release available at the
     download section

 o libnetfilter_conntrack: the netfilter conntrack library

     Since  conntrackd version 0.9.2 you can used the official release availble at
     http://www.netfilter.org/projects/libnetfilter_conntrack/files/

     Up to conntrackd version 0.9.1 use the unnoficial release available at the
     download section

2.2.2. Configuration

 Setting up conntrackd in statistics mode is rather easy. Just copy the
 configuration file

    # cp examples/stats/conntrackd.conf /etc/conntrackd.conf

2.2.3. Running conntrackd in statistics mode

 To run conntrackd in statistics mode:

    # conntrackd -S

 Alternatively, you can run conntrackd in daemon mode:

    # conntrackd -S -d

 In order to dump the statistics, just type:

    # conntrackd -s
