There are several tasks that are pending to be done, I have classified them
by dificulty levels:

Relatively easy
===============

- test ipv6 support
- improve shell scripts
- test NACK based protocol
- manpage for conntrackd

Requires some work
==================

- study better keepalived transitions
- implement support for TCP window tracking (patches are on the table)
	- at the moment you have to disable it:
	echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/netfilter/ip_conntrack_tcp_be_liberal
