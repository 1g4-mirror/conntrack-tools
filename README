This package contains two subdirectories:

cli (command line interface)
============================
This subdirectory contains the command line tool `conntrack' that provides an 
userspace interface to the connection tracking system. This tool let system
administrators perform different actions against the connection tracking
table. For more information see the manpage conntrack(8).

daemon
======
This subdirectory contains the userspace connection tracking daemon so-called
'conntrackd`. This daemon maintains a copy of the connection tracking table
in userspace. It is highly configurable and easily extensible. Currently it
covers the specific aspects of stateful GNU/Linux firewalls to enable high
availability solutions and can be used as statistics collector of the firewall
use.
